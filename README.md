This repository serves as my personal collection of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented from scratch in the C programming language. It documents my learning journey and provides a practical reference for core computer science concepts.

    * Doubly Linked List
    * Circular Linked List
* **Stacks**:
    * Implementation using Arrays
    * Implementation using Linked Lists
* **Queues**:
    * Implementation using Arrays
    * Implementation using Linked Lists
* **Trees**:
    * Binary Search Tree (BST)

### Algorithms Covered

* **Searching Techniques**:
    * Linear Search
    * Binary Search
* **Sorting Techniques**:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

Each implementation is a standalone C program that can be compiled and run individually.

### Prerequisites

You need a C compiler, such as **GCC**, installed on your system.

### Compilation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Rajaaditya-2207/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C.git](https://github.com/Rajaaditya-2207/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific folder**. For example, to run the Bubble Sort implementation:
    ```sh
    cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C/Sorting_techniques/bubble_sort/
    ```
3.  **Compile the C file** using GCC:
    ```sh
    gcc bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled executable**:
    ```sh
    ./bubble_sort
    ```
